Integrate twitter search


You need to make the slide creation process more intuitive, make it so that you can just type, so you type a title, press tab, choose a time, etc. And whenver you do anything to the box, javascript generates a preview to what it will look like (or perhaps this can all be javascript based), so as you type the title, it will type out a title. This little dialogue box should be able to be put around.

Force good design, there are only so many templates, people can submit new templates but they must be approved.

Also, you should be able drag anything in slidefeed in the order of the slides


Twitter Search:

<script>
new TWTR.Widget({
  version: 2,
  type: 'search',
  search: '@pennapps',
  interval: 30,
  title: '',
  subject: '',
  width: 'auto',
  height: 360,
  theme: {
    shell: {
      background: '#8ec1da',
      color: '#ffffff'
    },
    tweets: {
      background: '#ffffff',
      color: '#444444',
      links: '#1985b5'
    }
  },
  features: {
    scrollbar: true,
